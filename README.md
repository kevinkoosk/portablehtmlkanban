A Kanban in HTML JS and CSS, with a button to export and save changes

Modified from [this Codepen](https://codepen.io/karthikdevarticles/pen/PopxPwO)

With thanks to my collaborator, ChatGPT.

## How to use it:
- Create tasks, drag them around.
- Double click to display description.
- When you want to save, click on "Export".
- Copy that, and save into a new HTML.
- You need the CSS and JS to display the new HTML.

### Things that I tried to do, but failed:
- Get it to display Markdown description
- Get it to display line breaks.
